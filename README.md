## About this Research

The objective of this research is to design the extended state observer for the stator flux linkages by improving the transient estimation performance. 
The main contribution of this estimator are as follows:

<!-- - Stability of controller is ensured in the sense of Lyapunov.
- Weights of neural network and tracking error are bounded over time.
- Constraints are satisfied while adaptation (learning)
    - Weight norm constraint.
    - Control input saturation constraint (which is convex). -->
